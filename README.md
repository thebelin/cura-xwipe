cura-xwipe
__________

A Cura plugin for running a nozzle cleaner during prints on the X axis arm of a 3D printer

# Installation
Move XGantryWipe.py to the Cura /plugins/PostProcessingPlugin/scripts/ folder

# Use
In Cura Extensions > Post Processing > Modify G Code
Click Add a Script
Click XGantryWipe

# Method
This plugin removes the software endstop so it's possible to go beyond the bed measurement on the X gantry. This allows a nozzle cleaning brush to be positioned in the overflow area of the X gantry that can wiped between layers.
